# Details

This is an addon for Elder Scrolls Online.

The goal of this addon is to gently improve the experience bar without taking
too much away from its original design or intent. This slight improvement adds
three things to the default experience bar:

## Features

1. Adds actual experience numbers and/or a progress percentage value above the
experience bar. The default configuration is to show both.
2. Prevents the experience bar from automatically hiding after changing back to
the normal game view. The transparency value is configurable.
3. Temporarily shows the amount of experience gained below the experience bar.
The duration of this is configurable.
